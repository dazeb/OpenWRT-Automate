# OpenWRT-Automate-BASH-Scripts ðŸ“œ  
Scripts that automate tedious tasks when dealing with OpenWRT routers. I made this because i was sick of copy pasting.

Update 1 - The old documentation has some commands that have been improved in this first update. Added `
usb-modeswitch`
## What they do?  ðŸ“¢  
`usb-extroot.sh` - this will format and setup any usb stick and set it to use extroot.  

This means the USB stick will be mounted `root` and `/overlay` partitions so that there is more space to download packages. This is useful if your router has a very small amount of memory. See https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/additional-software/extroot_configuration for more info, the script basically follows the guide step by step and will gie you some output and information on what it is doing.

## How to run  
It is probably best to download and upload the script manually and upload it to the router yourself via ssh since cloning the repo will ask you for verification for github bla bla...  

Just download the script and send it over SCP.  

Once you have the script on the server use `chmod +x usb-extroot.sh` to make the script executable then run the script with `./usb-extroot.sh`.
